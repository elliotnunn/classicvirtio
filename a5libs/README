Abominable!

Our DRVR runtime requires all code to be compiled with -msep-data,
including libraries. These were rebuilt inside my Retro68-build
directory by replacing "xgcc" with a wrapper script, and running "make
clean && make" in the libgcc and newlib directories.

#!/bin/sh
echo "running my wrapper" >&2
exec $0-real "$@" -msep-data

Distributing libgcc under the GNU Runtime Library Exception, and newlib
is permissively licensed.
